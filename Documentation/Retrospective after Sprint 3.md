# Retrospective for sprint 3

## What was the goal:

* As part of the user stories mapping and the milestones for sprint three, we had set out to complete 32 user stories. 11 of the stories were overflow stories from sprint 2. 21 stories were completely new stories.
* The database was to contain tables for the user logs, the user profiles, as well as a table of words to be guessed.
* The login functionality and page routing was to be completed with a link to the database for storage and logging of users.
* Cookies were to be implemented in this sprint for faster login by the user.
* The end game of the single-player mode was to be finalzied, with provision to return to the title screen and a display for a win or loss. 
* The multiplayer functionality was to be implemented. This was to incorporate multiple grids and keyboards for at least two players with realtime live changes being visible to all players.
* The hangman functionality that allows a player in multiplayer to chose a word to be guessed is to be implemented.
* Friends information was to be set up, where players can see friends and make friends. 
* To create a log page that logs all user login activities.
* A friends chat function in the multiplayer game mode is to be implemented, with player identities being shown to the other players.
* Functionality of the single player mode is to be fully completed.
* Hashing of passwords needed to be completed for increased security.
* The final deployment to ensure a working end user product.

## What went well:

* We were successfull in implementing login functionality, end game functionality, multiplayer displays and play screen, and keyboard colouring.
* We implemented tests where possible to ensure the code was functioning correctly.
* We ensured that pull requests were reviewed and approved by at least 2 members as per review convention to ensure higher quality code and output. 
* The team came together despite busy schedules and other obligations. 
* A webserver socket was setup to serve the multiplayer functionality.
* The chat function was successful.
* Cookies were added to the code.
* The word entered by a user to be guessed in multiplayer can be checked against a list of words to verify if it is a word.
* All game modes were implemented successfully. (Single player, multiplayer with a limit of 3 users in a lobby room, and hangman game functionality).
* Bugs and code breaks that remained at the end of sprint 2 were successfully fixed.
* The hashing of user passwords was implemented successfully.

## What went wrong:

* We did not meet all functionality requirements at the end of the sprint.
* We did not complete the log functionality as well as a scoring system for multiplayer, based on the log.
* The increased sprint velocity, discussed in the retrospective for sprint 2, was not achieved. There was an improvement, but not to the set out amount. This was due to other obligations among the team. 
* Sprint 3 was not completed on time on the 6th of June 2022 as some of the major user stories were still incomplete such as the multiplayer game mode.

## What can be improved:

* The implementation of a user log that is visible to the player is to be achieved.
* Coverage of tests can be improved using sites such as coveralls. 
* An improved sprint velocity can be achieved. 
* The routing can be improved between all the multiple pages.
* A button for the user to retrieve or reset their password if they have forgotten it needs to be implemented.

## Sprint Velocity

* The sprint velocity for sprint 3 was 85 points. 
* The total time spent on sprint 3 was roughly 72 hours per person. 
* This exceeded our previous expectation of work achieved. However, some contribution to this is the closure of partially completed objectives during sprint 3.
* Despite this increased velocity our goals were not met entirely.
