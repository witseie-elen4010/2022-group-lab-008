# Retrospective for sprint 2

## What was the goal:

* As part of the user stories mapping and the milestones for sprint two, we had set out to complete 19 user stories. 9 of the stories were overflow stories from sprint 1. 9 were completely new stories.
* The login functionality and page routing was to be completed.
* The end game of the single-player mode was to be finalzied, with provision to return to the title screen and a display for a win or loss. 
* The basic multiplayer functionality was to be implemented. This was to incorporate multiple grids and keyboards for at least two players. 
* The colour changing of the keyboard on correct, incorrect, and misplaced guesses was to be implemented. 
* The more complex multiplayer functionality was to be implemented.
* Friends information was to be set up, where players can see friends and make friends. 
* Further game functionality was to be implemented such as longer word formats. 

## What went well:

* We were successfull in implementing basic login functionality, end game functionality, basic multiplayer displays, and keyboard colouring among other things.
* We implemented tests where possible to ensure the code was functioning correctly.
* We ensured that pull request were peer reviewed to ensure higher quality code and output. 
* The team came together despite busy schedules and other obligations. 
* The code was refactored to be more modular and suited to testing. 

## What went wrong:

* We did not complete the required amount of user stories. Only 8 of the expected 19 stories were completed. 
* The database and Azure deployment areas of work suffered some technical difficulties and were unable to be properly implemented. 
* The increased sprint velocity, discussed in the retrospective for sprint 1, was not achieved. This was due to other obligations among the team.
* Certain bugs and poorly structured code were implemeted which will require fixing in the coming sprint. 
* Sprint 1 was completed on time on the 23rd of May 2022, as the commits show; however, the sprint was accidentaly not closed on this date. Sprint 2 was opened correctly on the 23rd of May 2022 and marked the end of the sprint 1. However, the final closure of sprint 1 was mistakedly done later. 

## What can be improved:

* A greater deal of time can be spent to bring the program to a final version in the next week is a necessity. 
* The correctness of words can be checked using a database which contains a known set of words. 
* The database and Azure issues can be sorted out to permit work on currently unobtainable features. 
* Coverage of tests can be improved using sites such as coveralls. 
* The incomplete stories in sprint 2 can be completed timeously in sprint 3. 
* An improved sprint velocity can be achieved. 

## Sprint Velocity

* The sprint velocity for sprint 2 was 14 points. 
* The total time spent on sprint 2 was roughly 24 hours. 
* In order to complete the remaining roughly 50 points of work in the coming sprint 3, at least 72 hours of work is required. Note, this is per-person. 
* This requires a fuller commitment to working every day on the project to achieve the required outcome.
